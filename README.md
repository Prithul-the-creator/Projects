All of the following code files are some fun projects I did :)

Here are the following descriptions:

1. A [cold email bot](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/send_emails.py) that I used to reach out to professors instead of individually writing emails, saved me days of effort. Sent around 1000 emails in a few minutes and successfully got research opportunities
2. A [labeling tool](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/whisper.py) that can take any audio and accurately segment it into different speakers
3. A [trading bot](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/trading_bot.py) in work that will be able to individually buy and sell stocks on the open market based on market conditions. Uses metrics from RSI, SMA, News Conditions (Semantics), and Yearly Profits.
4. A very [simple version of my drone project](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/drone_code.py) that I submitted for a TSA competition. Takes a live audio input and writes drone code in real-time to move it.
5. A [movie recommendation system](https://github.com/Prithul-the-creator/EmailBot/blob/main/movie.py) that takes input from the user and provides the top 5 similar movies
